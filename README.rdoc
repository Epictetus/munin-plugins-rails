= Munin-Rails-Plugins

Collection of Consise Munin plugins for Rails server environments.
This will make monitoring your rails app a piece of cake.

This project containse munin plugins that not only work in munin, but are also concise (see references).
Most things in this repository rely heavily on the request-log-analyzer gem.

== What's in the box

* rails_requests - Running, active and maximum number of passenger instances as well as sessions.
* rails_database_time - Min, avg, max of database times.
* rails_request_duration - Min, avg, max of the total request durations.
* rails_request_error - Application errors and process blocker counters.
* rails_requests - Get, put, post and delete requests.
* rails_view_render_time - Min, avg and max view render times.

== Installation

The plugins follow the default munin installation scheme:
* git clone git://github.com/barttenbrinke/munin-plugins-rails.git
* cp rails_requests /usr/share/munin/plugins/
* chmod +x /usr/share/munin/plugins/rails_requests
* ln -s /usr/share/munin/plugins/rails_requests /etc/munin/plugins/rails_requests
* vi /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/munin-node

Paste the configuration from the documentation of rails_requests into the munin-node file.
    [rails_requests]
    env.log_file '/path/to/production.log'
    user www-data
    command /usr/local/bin/ruby %c

Run "/etc/munin/plugins/passenger-status autoconf" and "/etc/munin/plugins/passenger-status" to test the plugin.

For more detailed information, see the documentation embedded in the plugin.
Each plugin is packed with an example config and a ln -s you can copy.

== Problems
* sudo gem install request-log-analyzer
* Check if the paths in the plugin configuration are correct.
* Make sure the specified user is allowed to write to /tmp and access your rails logfile.

If you encounter performance problems with your app, please take a look at the request-log-analyzer wiki on
examples on how to drill down to the core of your problem. If you want to hire an expert, please visit us at
